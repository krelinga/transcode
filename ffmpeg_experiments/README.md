## ffmpeg experiments

The goal here is to be able to transcode directly with ffmpeg and not use handbrake.

This is interesting because I want to have more control over how the transcoding works, including things like my own logic to select subtitle tracks, output formats, etc.  Also, this is just a chance to learn stuff!
